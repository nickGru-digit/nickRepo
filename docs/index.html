        <p>If you want to see a cool shark, <a href="about.html">click here</a>.</p>
        <p>I don't know what I should put in this really. I think some <em>random</em> stuff will
            do. If you want some cookies, click <a
                href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies/">here</a>.</p>
        <h4>This cooking website sucks.</h4>
        <p>It takes literally 30 page lengths to get to the cookie recipe. That is only half-way
            down the page. I didn't count how many advertisements there were, but, even with my
            adblocker enabled, there were quite a few.</p>
        <p>If you want to see somebody more talented than me, look at Ash Maloney's portfolio <a
                href="https://ashluvzu.github.io/Portfolio-100/">here</a>. This is the greatest
            website in the world <a href="https://28awesomebugs.org/">if you like bugs</a>.</p>
        <p>I love randomly <strong>bolding</strong> words for emphasis</p>
